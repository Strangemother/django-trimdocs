# Development Server

Django trimdocs allows you to run the standard Django `runserver`, but also includes a `dev_serve` of which configures trimdoc settings for free

## `dev_serve`

> The `dev_serve` shadows the existing `runserver` with additional parameters.

To run the dev server:

```bash
trimdocs dev_serve ./mysettings.py
```

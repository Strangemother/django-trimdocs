{% comment "What" %}
    The _null_ or "None" file, serves as the _blank_ frame for the
    markdown root include.

    Every markdown file extends from the root, if no extends are applied, the content is simply included within the parent template (this one)

    This ensures the base import can always use block `body.main`

    Use this as the `trimdocs_global_frame`

        context['trimdocs_global_frame'] = "trimdocs/base.html"
{% endcomment %}{% block body.main %}<p>base file 'body' block</p>{% endblock body.main %}
